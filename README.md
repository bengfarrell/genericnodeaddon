Hi there.

This is a node addon made with C++.

In fact, it's a few addons.

They aren't terribly useful - one returns a string of "hello". Another returns random coordinates in either 2D or 3D space.
The last one can count to really high numbers.

Even better, this whole repo is setup to work in Atom-Shell. You'll need to "apm install" instead of "npm install" if you wanna use Atom-Shell.
They'll still work fine with plain old Node.js though.
